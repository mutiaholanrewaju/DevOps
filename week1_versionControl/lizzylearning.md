## Session 1: Introduction to DevOps, Version Control, and Git

During this session, I learnt about the idea and concept behind DevOps. It is basically a combination software development(Dev) and operations(Ops). The aim here is to integrate and facilitate a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility across cross-functional teams

I further learnt about the **7'Cs of DevOps**. These are the phases involved in the DevOps Lifecycle.

- Continuous Development
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Testing
- Continuous Deployment/Delivery
- Continuous Monitoring
- Continuous Feedback
- Continuous Operations

We further touched on Intro to Linux, the various kernels available. We touched on some basic linux commands: ls, cmd, pwd, mkdir and a host of others. We also learnt about some intro to Git.


## Session 2: Git and GitHub Collaboration Workflow
At the beginning of this session, we were being reminded of the DevOps culture and this stuck with me. 
It is a culture that emphasizes continuous learning, automation and also improved processesthrough feedback loops. 

**Devops Principles**
- Automation
- Collaboration
- Customer-Centric Decision Making
- Continuous Improvement
- Responsibility Through the Lifecycle
- Failure as a Learning Opportunity

We further touched on Intro to Version Control, which is a system that records changes to a set of files over time. A very good example here is GIT. It allows for easy collaboration. Helps to keep track of live and development code all in one place.

We further went through Git terminologies and what each of them does. Learning about branching, commiting, fetching, cloning. I had to personally pay attention to the merging process. Over time, I've had a number of merge conflicts. So I had to consciously learn that i need to pull from themaster or main default branchs before pushing any update from my end. 

And yeah, this image typically depicts it.
