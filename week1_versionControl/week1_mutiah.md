# DevOps Class - Week 1 Highlights

## Day 1: Introduction to DevOps

- **DevOps Overview**: DevOps is a methodology that helps build reliable software faster. It brings together development and operations teams to increase collaboration, improve workflow, and reduce time to production.
- **Agile and DevOps**: DevOps incorporates Agile practices to streamline operations and enhance collaboration between teams.
- **Shift Left Concept**: In DevOps, the idea of "Shift Left" encourages integrating developers and testers into one team to ensure faster, smoother production cycles, minimize delays, and avoid process waste (e.g., release inefficiencies).
  
### DevOps Lifecycle Stages:
1. **Plan**: Stakeholders gather feedback from end users to set the roadmap and foundation for continuous development. Tools like Jira are commonly used at this stage.
2. **Code**
3. **Build**
4. **Test**
5. **Release**
6. **Deploy**
7. **Monitor**

- **DevOps Major Phases**:
  - Continuous Development
  - Continuous Integration
  - Continuous Testing
  - Continuous Deployment/Delivery
  - Continuous Monitoring

- **Key Tools**:
  - **CI/CD**: Tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins are used to automate continuous integration and delivery processes.

- **What Makes You a DevOps Engineer**:
  - Knowledge of **basic Linux commands** like:
    - `ls`: List directory contents
    - `cd`: Change directory
    - `mkdir`: Create a new directory
    - `rmdir`: Remove a directory
    - `touch`: Create a new empty file
    - `mv`: Move or rename files and directories

- **DevOps Principles**:
  - Collaboration
  - Customer-Centric Decision Making
  - Continuous Improvement
  - Responsibility Throughout the Lifecycle
  - Automation
  - Learning From Failure

## Day 2: Introduction to Version Control

- **Version Control**: A system that records changes to a set of files over time, allowing you to track modifications, collaborate, and revert changes when needed.
- **Git**: A widely-used version control system that enables developers to manage source code history and collaborate effectively.
- **Git Commands**: Basic git commands like clone, fetch, push, pull, add and more were covered

### Practical Sessions:
- Hands-on practice was done with basic Linux commands and version control using Git.
