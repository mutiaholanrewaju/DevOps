# DevOps Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress through a comprehensive DevOps learning program aimed at enhancing my skills as a Cloud Data Analytics Engineer. The journey covers foundational concepts of DevOps, automation, cloud computing, and CI/CD pipelines. Each week focuses on a specific area of DevOps with practical, hands-on projects that build towards creating and maintaining cloud-based infrastructure and applications.

## Week 1: Version Control & Git Basics

**Overview:**  
In Week 1, I learned the essentials of DevOps, focusing on Git and version control. I explored how to set up GitHub repositories, create branches, collaborate with others, resolve merge conflicts, and use Git workflows effectively.

**Project:**  
Collaborate on a shared GitHub repository, covering key tasks like cloning, forking, branch creation, committing changes, pushing updates, and managing pull requests.
